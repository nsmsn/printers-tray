## Coming soon.

Typekit doesn’t have a built-in feature where users can create and share their own lists, and currently the only way to save fonts within Typekit itself is by using the ‘favorites’ feature or adding fonts to a kit. 

There are some wonderfully crafted type choices that have been available on Typekit for years, and new fonts are always being added. As the service approaches its ten-year anniversary, I wanted to highlight some overlooked choices from smaller foundries available in Typekit’s Portfolio plan as well as a few premium fonts available from Typekit Marketplace. 

While a few of these choices might appear in some official Typekit lists, none of the fonts in my curated lists will be featured in the [Favorite Fonts List](https://typekit.com/lists/favorite-fonts).
